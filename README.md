Introduction
---------------

CodezBank is just a small application that stores source code snippets 
organized in a hierarchical manner with basic search ability. You just 
copy and paste the code snippet into or from this application via the 
Clipboard. If you have a bag of coding tricks, then you want to keep them in this app.

Background
--------------

Every time I work on some project, I always find myself digging through 
books and my old files to see how I did one or another piece of code. 
Although it works, it usually requires a lot of time. 
Sites like CodeProject keeps code always available, but if I am offline or 
on a remote location without the connectivity, then I have 
always wanted a small application that keeps the code snippets organized and handy.
